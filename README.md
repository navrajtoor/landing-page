# landing-page
This is a very simple landing page created in HTML and designed in CSS. This landing page shows my ability to include links and images of various sizes in HTML. It also deplays my ability to utilize flexbox to design the different elements of the webpage such as the header, footer, and 4 section blocks. This design could be used for many aspects such as a business that wants to show off some testimonials. To build off of this project I could include other pages for the links to lead to and implement some Javascript to make the page more interactivity that isn't possible from just HTML and CSS.
